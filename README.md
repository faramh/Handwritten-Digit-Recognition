Overview
This project explores handwritten digit recognition using Radial Basis Function (RBF) classification optimized with K-Means clustering. The goal is to improve classification accuracy by selecting optimal centroids and refining feature extraction techniques.

Methods
The dataset was preprocessed using normalization and centering. Feature extraction techniques included zoning, vertical/horizontal histograms, HOG, and K-Means clustering. The RBF model was trained using centroids from K-Means, followed by weight optimization using the delta rule.

Results & Conclusion
The RBF classifier, combined with K-Means, outperformed conventional methods like KNN and Na√Øve Bayes. Zoning-based feature extraction proved superior to histogram-based methods. Further optimization of RBF parameters could enhance accuracy, making this approach promising for real-world digit recognition applications.
